# Non-Ansible Configuration Notes

There are a number of infrastructure setup tasks that are not currently automated by Ansible, either for technical reasons or due to lack of time available by the individuals involved in these processes. This document is intended to collect that information, to serve as a task list for additional Ansible work and as a central place to note special tasks.
